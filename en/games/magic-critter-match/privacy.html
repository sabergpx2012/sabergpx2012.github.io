    <p>Last updated: 2025-10-22</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information when you use Magic Critter Match on iOS and our related website. We designed the app to collect only what is necessary to provide core features and to comply with Apple App Store policies.</p>

    <h2>What We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Information you provide voluntarily:</strong> If you contact us for support, we may receive your email address, device information you share, and the contents of your message. We use this information only to respond to your request and improve the Service.</p>

    <p><strong>Device and usage data (non‑personal):</strong> We may collect limited technical data such as device model, OS version, app version, language, performance metrics, crash logs, and approximate region (derived from IP). This data does not identify you personally and is used to maintain and improve the app.</p>

    <h2>No Cloud Save or Account Linking</h2>
    <p>The app does not use cloud save, account sign‑in, or platform account linking. Your local progress is stored on your device and is removed if you delete the app.</p>

    <h2>Advertising and Tracking</h2>
    <p>The app may display third‑party ads. On iOS, advertising can use Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) to deliver and measure ads. We request your permission via Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) prompt where required. If you do not allow tracking, the app will not access IDFA and ads shown may be contextual rather than personalized.</p>

    <p><strong>Ad partners used in our app (iOS):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>AdMob (Google LLC). How Google uses data and your choices: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></li>
      <li>Unity Ads (Unity Technologies). Privacy Policy: <a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Your choices on iOS:</strong> You can change tracking permission in iOS Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking, and reset the advertising identifier in Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Apple Advertising. Even if you opt out, you may still see ads that are not personalized.</p>

    <h2>App Store “Privacy Nutrition Labels” Mapping</h2>
    <p>For App Store Connect disclosure, the app may collect the following categories through third‑party advertising SDKs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data Not Linked to You:</strong> coarse location (from IP), device identifiers (IDFA if permission granted), diagnostics, and usage data for advertising and analytics.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Linked to You:</strong> none by us. If you contact support, your email and message content are used solely for support and are not combined with advertising data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect sensitive data categories such as health, financial information, precise location, contacts, photos, or microphones.</p>

    <h2>Do Not Track and Opt‑Out</h2>
    <p>We honor iOS tracking permission. If you deny permission or later disable tracking, we prevent access to IDFA. Some partners may still receive non‑personal data required to operate their services, such as IP address for fraud prevention and delivery.</p>

    <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell personal information. We share data only with service providers (for example, advertising or crash reporting) to operate the Service under our instructions and this Policy, or when required by law.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The app is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us and we will delete it.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use commercially reasonable safeguards to protect data. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure.</p>

    <h2>International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be processed on servers located outside your country. We take steps to ensure appropriate protections consistent with applicable laws.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your region, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict the use of your information. To make a request, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@example.com">support@example.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. We will post any changes on this page with an updated “Last updated” date.</p>
