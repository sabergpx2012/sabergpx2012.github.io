    <h2>Privacy Policy for Magic Water Puzzle</h2>
    <p>Please read this policy to understand what information Magic Water Puzzle collects and how we use it. This policy applies to the Magic Water Puzzle application and website.</p>

    <h3>Information We Collect and How We Use It</h3>
    <p><strong>Personal information you provide:</strong> When you contact us or use certain features, we may ask for your name, email address, or other contact details. We use this information to communicate with you, provide support, and contact you when necessary. We may also use it to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding unauthorized use of the Services. If we use this information for a purpose different from the one for which it was collected, we will seek your consent beforehand.</p>
    <p><strong>Non-personal information:</strong> We collect anonymous, non‑personal information such as IP address, operating system version, device details (e.g., device model), advertising identifier, browser type and language, your web request, and the date and time of your request. This information does not identify you individually and may be used for marketing, auditing, providing or improving our services, and developing new services.</p>

    <h3>Cloud Save (Google Play Games Services – Saved Games)</h3>
    <p>We use Google Play Games Services (Saved Games) on Android to let you back up your game progress, items, and settings to the cloud and restore them after reinstalling or switching devices.</p>
    <p>When you use this feature, data related to your game progress (for example, level progression, item ownership, preferences, timestamps) is synced via your Google account and stored on Google’s cloud infrastructure to provide the cloud save and account‑linking functionality.</p>
    <p>Google may process information necessary to provide this feature (for example, save files linked to your Google account, timestamps, and technical records). For information about Google’s advertising and related technologies and your choices, see
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Your control:</strong> We provide an in‑app “Delete Save” button that deletes your cloud save for this game. If you use this button, your cloud save associated with your Google account will be deleted for this title. If you sign out of Google Play Games or revoke permissions, cloud sync and restoration may not be available.</p>

    <h3 id="ads">Advertising</h3>
    <p>Magic Water Puzzle shows ads and uses third‑party services to deliver and measure ads. These services may collect data about your device (for example, IP address) and how you interact with ads. They may also use technologies similar to cookies, especially mobile advertising IDs. This data can be used to infer approximate location and to show interest‑based ads.</p>
    <p><strong>Advertising partners used in our app:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>AdMob (Google LLC). Learn how Google uses data in advertising and your choices:
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a>
      </li>
      <li>Unity Ads (Unity Technologies). Privacy Policy:
        <a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unity.com/legal/privacy-policy</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Your ad choices:</strong> You can manage Google ad personalization in Google Ad Settings or manage identifiers in your device settings. On Android, you can reset or delete your device’s Advertising ID in Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Ads. Even if you turn off personalized ads, you may still see ads based on factors such as approximate location (derived from IP), device/browser type, or search terms.</p>

    <h3>Information Sharing</h3>
    <p>Except as noted below, we do not share your personal information with third parties unless you give us permission.</p>
    <p>We share personal information with third parties only:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide products or services you have requested and only under our instructions and in compliance with this policy (for example, with Google Play Games Services to enable cloud saves).</li>
      <li>When required by law, regulation, or litigation.</li>
      <li>When we determine disclosure is necessary for law enforcement or other issues of public importance.</li>
      <li>In connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets. We will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may share aggregated, non‑personal information (for example, the number of users who viewed a certain page or clicked a particular advertisement).</p>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>We value your trust in providing us your personal information and strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
    <p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click a third‑party link, you will be directed to that site. These external sites are not operated by us. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of those websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third‑party sites or services.</p>

    <h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
    <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it immediately. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take necessary actions.</p>

    <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.</p>
