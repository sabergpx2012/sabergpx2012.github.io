    <p>Last updated: 2025-11-10</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Magic Critter Match handles information on iOS (Apple App Store) and Android (Google Play) and on our related website. We collect only what is necessary to operate the app, show ads, maintain security, and improve quality.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Information you provide:</strong> If you contact support, we may receive your email address and message contents. We use these only to respond and provide support.</p>
    <p><strong>Device and usage data (non-personal):</strong> We may collect device model, OS and app version, language, performance metrics, crash logs, and approximate location inferred from IP. This data is used to operate, secure, and improve the app and is not used to identify you personally.</p>

    <h2>Accounts and Cloud Save</h2>
    <p>The app does not require sign-in and does not use cloud save at this time. Your game progress is stored locally on your device and is removed if you uninstall the app.</p>

    <h2>Advertising and Analytics</h2>
    <p>We may show ads and use third-party SDKs that process limited device and usage data to deliver, measure, and prevent fraud. Depending on your platform and choices, partners may access mobile advertising identifiers.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>AdMob (Google LLC) — <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></li>
      <li>Unity Ads (Unity Technologies) — <a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Platform-specific details</h3>
    <p><strong>iOS (Apple):</strong> We request permission via App Tracking Transparency (ATT) if we need to access the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) for personalized ads or cross-app tracking. If you deny permission, we do not access IDFA and you may see contextual ads.</p>
    <p><strong>Android (Google Play):</strong> We may access the device’s Advertising ID to deliver or measure ads. You can reset or delete the Advertising ID and limit ad personalization in device settings.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Change tracking permission in Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking. Manage Apple Advertising in Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Apple Advertising.</li>
      <li><strong>Android:</strong> Manage Advertising ID in Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Ads (path may vary by device). You can reset/delete the ID and turn off personalized ads.</li>
      <li>You can disable analytics/ads personalization where provided in-app (if available), and you can contact us to request data deletion related to support messages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell personal information. We share data only with service providers that help us operate the app (for example, advertising networks, crash reporting) under contractual obligations and this Policy, or when required by law, to protect safety, or in connection with corporate transactions.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The app is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child provided personal information, contact us and we will delete it.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use commercially reasonable safeguards to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights and Requests</h2>
    <p>Depending on your region, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your information. For requests, contact <a href="mailto:VanilleKR@gmail.com">VanilleKR@gmail.com</a>. We may ask you to verify your request.</p>

    <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Service providers may process data on servers outside your country. We take steps to ensure appropriate protections consistent with applicable laws.</p>

    <h2>App Store/Play Store Disclosures</h2>
    <h3>Apple App Store (Privacy Nutrition Labels)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data Not Linked to You:</strong> coarse location (from IP), device identifiers (IDFA if ATT permission granted), usage data, diagnostics for ads/analytics.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Linked to You:</strong> none by us. Support emails you send are used only for customer support and are not linked to advertising data.</li>
      <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> Only if you grant ATT permission; otherwise no tracking or IDFA access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Google Play (Data safety)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Collected:</strong> device identifiers (Advertising ID), approximate location (from IP), diagnostics, and app interactions for ads/analytics.</li>
      <li><strong>Shared:</strong> limited data with advertising partners to serve/measure ads and prevent fraud. We do not sell data.</li>
      <li><strong>Security:</strong> data in transit is encrypted; you can request deletion of support correspondence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. We will post updates here with a new “Last updated” date.</p>
